**Note: The beans are the culprit with time here, but well worth it. If you want to use canned beans instead to save time, make sure you rinse them off super well so they cause less bloating and gas. FUN FACT: the more beans you eat over time, the more your body gets used to them.**

## Chipotle Bowl Instructions

### For the beans

### Dry bean method

1. Place the dry beans in a stock pot and cover with water. Add the ground coriander, bay leaves, seeds, sazón, and large pinches of salt (the water will be drained so be generous: think ocean water). Place the pot over high heat and bring to a rolling boil.
2. Boil for 10 minutes and then cover and turn off the heat. Let the beans sit for at least 2 hours in the hot cooking water, best overnight.
3. Drain the beans and rinse them off very well. Remove the bay leaves and garlic cloves.
4. Place a large skillet or dutch oven over medium high heat. Add 3 tbsp olive oil and once hot, add the diced onions. Once the diced onions are translucent, add the garlic and spices. Cook for 1 minute or until very fragrant. Add the broth and once boiling, add the beans. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans for 1-2 hours.
5. Remove the beans from the heat and let cool. Transfer the beans to an airtight container.

### Canned bean method

1. Rinse the beans in a colander very well. The liquid in the can causes the most gas and bloating so get rid of it!
2. Place a large skillet or dutch oven over medium high heat. Add 3 tbsp olive oil and once hot, add the diced onions. Once the diced onions are translucent, add the garlic and spices. Cook for 1 minute or until very fragrant. Add the broth and once boiling, add the beans. Reduce the heat and simmer the beans for ~30 minutes.
3. Remove the beans from the heat and let cool. Transfer the beans to an airtight container.

### For the Adobo Chicken instructions

1. Pound chicken about 1/4 inch thick and place in a gallon ziplock bag.
2. Blend the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, ground cumin, honey, lime juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder until smooth. Pour the marinade into the ziplock bag and marinate the chicken for at least two hours or overnight.
3. Place a skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp of olive oil. Remove the chicken from the bag and once the oil is hot, place the chicken in the skillet. You may have to cook the chicken in batches depending on how big the breasts and your skillet are. Cook the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, making sure to not disturb the chicken so that it can develop a char. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes before dicing into cubes. Once cooled, transfer the chicken to an airtight container.

### For the cilantro lime rice instructions

1. Place all the ingredients except for the cilantro and lime juice in a 2-quart saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 45 minutes.
2. Once the rice is done cooking, turn the heat off and let it sit for 15 minutes. Remove the lid, and remove the garlic clove and bay leaves. Add the cilantro and lime juice and fluff the rice with a fork, mixing in the cilantro as you fluff. Once cooled, transfer the rice to an airtight container.

### For the pepper and onions instructions

Place a skillet over medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt. Toss well and let sit in an even layer, mixing every few minutes. You want the onions and peppers to develop a slight char around the edges. Cook until the onions start to become transparent ~8 minutes. Once cooled, transfer the onion and peppers to an airtight container.

### For the guacamole instructions

Add all ingredients directly to an airtight container. Mash the avocado using a fork and mix the guacamole well. Place the avocado pits into the guacamole to keep it green longer.
