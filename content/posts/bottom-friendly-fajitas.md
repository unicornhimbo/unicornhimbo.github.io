**Note: This bottom-friendly fajita recipe is meant to teach you all about navigating your trigger foods. For example, you'll notice we use kale in the fajita peppers and leave out the traditional onions. But if you didn't have an onion sensitivity, you would leave them in. The same goes for the dairy-free sour cream. Use regular sour cream if you're not lactose intolerant. We also use chicken but this recipe is totally customizable to whatever your gut and butt digests best!**

## Bottom-Friendly Fajita Instructions

### For the fajita chicken instructions

Cover chicken breasts in plastic wrap and pound thinly using a meat mallet or a flat-bottom pan. Remove the plastic wrap and squeeze the lime on both sides of the chicken. Mix the saffron seasoning, Uncle Chris' (optional but highly recommended), and salt together and sprinkle on both sides of the chicken. Set aside to marinate for as long as possible, preferably at least 1 hour.

### For the fajita mushrooms instructions

Remove the stalk/stem from the mushroom caps. Squeeze the lime on both sides of the mushroom caps. Cover both sides of the mushroom caps in soy sauce and set aside to marinate.

### While the chicken and mushrooms marinate, make the sides

### For the guacamole instructions

Add all ingredients to a bowl, and using a fork, mash the avocado until it's still a little chunky. Mix well and taste for lime, cilantro, and salt. You need more than you might think but start light. Set aside.

### For the vegan sour cream instructions

Mix the ingredients together in a bowl and set aside.

### Cooking everything

1. Place a cast iron or saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add one tortilla at a time, flipping every 30 seconds until both sides are golden brown. Repeat until all tortillas are done. Set aside.
   1. **NOTE:** I use flour tortillas in this recipe because they most agree with my body. Whole wheat tortillas can make me feel very bloated. Choose tortillas that you know your body agrees with the most.
2. In the same cast iron or saute pan, add 1 tbsp olive oil, and once hot, add the mushroom caps. Cook for ~3-4 minutes until slightly charred and flip to cook for another 3-4 minutes. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board.
   1. **NOTE:** If the mushrooms charred a lot, you may want to wipe the pan well before cooking the chicken next so the bits do not continue to burn in the pan.
3. In the same cast iron or saute pan, add 1 tbsp olive oil, and once hot, add the chicken breasts. Cook for about 4-5 minutes per side until golden brown. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board to rest.
4. In the same cast iron or saute pan, add 1 tbsp olive oil, and once hot, add the bell peppers. Cook for about 2 minutes and then add spices and salt. Cook for another minute or so, trying not to stir too much so the peppers start to slightly char.
5. Add kale and cook for another minute. Once kale is wilted, add a splash of dry white wine (or water) and scrape the bits off the bottom of the pan. Let the peppers and kale cook in an even layer for about 2 more minutes finalizing a good char. Remove from the pan and set aside.

### Assembly

Assemble a spread by slicing the chicken breasts into strips against the grain, slicing the mushrooms into strips, and placing them all on a platter alongside the peppers and kale. Serve with guacamole, vegan sour cream, and any other toppings your heart desires. The only thing that's left to do is to make yourself a fajita taco. Bottoms up!
