## Dairy Free Creme Brulee Ingredients

- 1 1/3 C plant-based milk (unsweetened, non-flavored, preferably pea protein-based or a thick and creamy oat or almond milk).
- 2/3 C canola oil
- 5 egg yolks
- 1/2 C sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Additional sugar for topping

## Dairy Free Creme Brulee Directions

### Step 1

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

### Step 2

Combine the plant-based milk and canola oil to a blender and blend until combined and homogenous, about 1-2 minutes. You now have plant-based heavy cream!

### Step 3

In a saucepan, add the blended plant-based cream, vanilla extract, and salt and cook over low heat until it's hot but not boiling.

### Step 4

In a mixing bowl beat the egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow and smooth. Add a splash of the hot cream to the egg mixture and mix vigorously. Add another splash and mix again. Add one more splash and after mixing, pour the egg mixture into the remaining hot cream and mix well.

### Step 5

Pour the cream mixture into 4-6 6-ounce ramekins (depending on how big you want these babies) and place them on a baking sheet or dish with a rim around the edge. Fill the pan/dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the ramekins.

### Step 6

Bake for 35-40 minutes or until the centers are slightly wobbly. Cool completely until ready to serve (tip: these can be covered and put away for a few days until you're ready to top them with sugar and torch them).

### Step 7

When you're ready to dig in, top each creme brulee with ~1 tsp of sugar in a thin, even layer and place the ramekins under a broiler. Try to get them 2-3 inches from the broiler's heat source. Broil until the sugars are browned and caramelized. Black spots are good! This takes about 5 minutes so keep a close eye on the creme brulees. Bottoms up!
