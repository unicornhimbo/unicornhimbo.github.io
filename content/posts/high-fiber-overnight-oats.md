**This recipe is all about the base. The base made plain has a few advantages: 1) it'll keep longer in the fridge 2) you can mix up your overnight oats each morning so you don't get tired of the same flavor day after day.**

**The best part about this recipe is that if you realize you forgot to whip these up, it won't take you but 5 minutes to get them together before bedtime.**
