**This vegan cheese sauce truly is an iconic foundational recipe. You can make Texas Queso (as shown in the image above), casseroles, enchiladas, and even mac n' cheese. The sky is the limit with this vegan cheese sauce and it ain't going to send you running to the bathroom.**

## Vegan Cheese Sauce Ingredients

- 4 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled
- 1 carrot, peeled and ends removed
- ¼ C red bell pepper, or simply the top portion of the bell pepper
- ½ sweet yellow onion
- ½ C cashews
- Salt
- ¾ C Nutritional Yeast
- 1 C reserved cooking liquid

**If you have a nut allergy, add silken tofu to the blender during step 4. All other steps in this vegan cheese sauce recipe stay the same.**

## Vegan Cheese Sauce Directions

### Step 1

Combine the potatoes, carrot, red bell pepper, onion, cashews, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan. Cover with water.

### Step 2

Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the cashews and potatoes are very soft.

### Step 3

Reserve some of the cooking water, then strain the vegetable mixture.

### Step 4

Transfer the vegetables to a blender. Add the nutritional yeast and 1/2 cup of the reserved cooking water.

### Step 5

Blend until very smooth.

### Step 6

Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, nutritional yeast, or cooking water as needed. You now have a vegan cheese sauce for dips, casseroles, and mac n' cheese.
