**Because butter is virtually lactose-free, we don't count it here. But if you want to make this recipe vegan, you can use a plant-based butter. The lobster in the photo is a way to elevate this recipe for special occasions...like a hookup turning into a relationship.**

## Dairy Free Mac n' Cheese Ingredients

### For the Macaroni

- 2 lb macaroni shells
- 6 tbsp butter OR vegan butter
- 7 oz vegan cheddar shreds (the kind that melts!)
- The Bottom's Digest vegan cheese sauce

- 1 C Panko bread crumbs
- 2 tbsp butter OR vegan butter

### Step 3

Fill a large stock pot ¾ of the way with water. Place over high heat. Once the water begins to boil, heavily salt the water and add the macaroni. Cook according to the package’s instructions for al dente. Reserve 2 cups of pasta water and strain the pasta. Mix the pasta with the dairy-free cheese sauce, vegan cheddar cheese shreds, and a fat splash of pasta water (more if needed if the pasta isn’t creamy enough). Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated, and the dairy-free cheese shreds are melted. Pour the pasta into a 9x13 baking pan. Top the macaroni with panko bread crumbs and small pieces of cubed butter, spreading out everything evenly.

### Step 4

Bake for 25 minutes or until the top is golden brown. Serve immediately. Bottoms up!
